##Description
metaPixel is a 3d-printed, modular, extendable, magnetic pixel display for showing "retro" animations well known from the *good old days*â„¢.

![metaPixel Design][metaPixelAll]
The whole design uses a lot of magnets for adding strength to inter module connections, to hold the module cover and diffusors in place or to stick the modules onto its base.

The metaPixel display consists of 4 main parts:

1. steel plate
2. 20 metaPixel modules
3. controller and power supply 
4. Frame with connectors 

### Steel plate
The central structure of the whole installation is a 700x700x0.5 mm sheet of steel. Both, the display modules as well as the controller and the power supply are attached with magnets to both sides of the plate.

### Frame
The steel plate is mounted to a wood frame with 20 ring magnets. 
![Frame][metaPixelFrame]

The wood frame contains cut outs for a standard power connector as well as for DMX (3 pin XLR) and USB and the ring magnets.

###metaPixel Module
Each module contains 20 "intelligent" RGB LEDs in a 4 by 5 grid.

The modules interconnect via a 3 pin connector. While the power connections goes straight from the input to the output with taps for each LED stripe. 
The data signal is routed on a zigzag path trough the stripes.
![metaPixel Box][metaPixelBox]
The LED carrier rests on top of four pillars which also contain some of the magnets.

Four magnets in the corners of the box holds the cover and grid in place.
